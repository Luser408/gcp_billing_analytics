My GCP Billing Analytics Project
A Looker-based analytics solution for gaining deep insights into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) billing data. This project provides a scalable and customizable framework to monitor cloud costs, identify high-spending services, and improve financial decision-making across cloud projects.

Overview
This project is built to help organizations track and optimize their GCP cloud spend using BigQuery billing export data and LookML. It empowers finance and DevOps teams to monitor trends, analyze usage patterns, and set up proactive cost governance.

Features
Dynamic dashboards for cost trends, service usage, and project-level expenses.

Custom measures to identify cost spikes and high-expense services.

Time-based filtering and label segmentation for granular analysis.

Modular LookML files for easy customization and scaling.

Setup Instructions
To deploy this project, you'll need access to a Looker instance and a GCP BigQuery dataset with billing export enabled.

Create a Project in Looker
Start a new project in the Looker IDE and upload all LookML files.

Connect to GCP Billing Data
Configure your model file to connect to a BigQuery dataset containing GCP billing export data.

Deploy & Explore
Switch to Production Mode and explore dashboards for insights into spending trends, top services, and cost anomalies.

Dashboards
GCP Cost Trends: Visualize historical cost growth and fluctuation.

Service-Level Analysis: Identify which services contribute most to your spend.

Project-Level Comparison: Track budget allocation and efficiency per GCP project.

Data Source
This project relies on data from the GCP billing export to BigQuery, which includes detailed information on usage, SKU-level charges, project identifiers, and labels.

Use Cases
Cost optimization and budgeting

Chargeback and showback reporting

Cloud financial governance

Trend analysis and forecasting

Notes
This project is intended as a foundational analytics layer. You may need to adjust the LookML for your specific billing schema or organizational tags.

Ensure proper data permissions are set up for BigQuery access in Looker.

Built to simplify GCP cloud cost management with actionable insights.
